npm run docker:build      # Build worker Docker image
npm run docker:run        # Run worker container locally
npm run deploy:azure      # Deploy to Azure VM
```

### Utilities
```bash
npm run prefetch:emojis   # Cache common emojis
```

## 🌐 Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
All your existing credentials have been preserved and organized:

- ✅ **Supabase**: Database and authentication

npm run worker:test
```

### 3. Monitor Performance
```bash
# Check worker status on Azure VM
ssh -i "C:\Users\aman7\Downloads\script-to-video_key.pem" azureuser@20.244.44.142 'docker logs whop-video-worker'
```
