# 🎥 Video Generation System - Setup Complete!

I've analyzed your video generation setup and created comprehensive documentation to help you debug and fix the issues.

## 🎯 What I Found

Your system has a **job queue architecture**:
1. **Frontend** creates jobs in Appwrite
2. **Azure VM Worker** polls and processes jobs
3. **Worker** renders videos with Remotion
4. **Worker** uploads to Azure Blob Storage
5. **Frontend** polls for completion and downloads

**The main issues were**:
- ✅ Missing `APPWRITE_VIDEO_JOBS_COLLECTION_ID` in `worker.env` → **FIXED**
- ✅ Missing `AZURE_BLOB_CONTAINER` in `worker.env` → **FIXED**
- ⚠️ Need to verify worker is running on Azure VM
- ⚠️ Need to verify Appwrite collections exist
- ⚠️ Need to verify Azure Storage container exists

   - `test-video-pipeline.js` - Test complete workflow
   - `worker-health-check.sh` - Test worker on Azure VM

## ⚡ Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### 1. Test Appwrite Connection

```bash
npm run test:appwrite
```

This checks if your Appwrite database is configured correctly.

### 2. Update Worker on Azure VM

The `worker/worker.env` file was missing variables. I've fixed it locally, now you need to:

```bash
# On your local machine, copy the updated file
scp worker/worker.env user@74.225.128.201:/path/to/whop-app/worker/

# SSH to Azure VM
ssh user@74.225.128.201

# Restart worker
sudo systemctl restart video-worker

# Check it's running
sudo systemctl status video-worker
```

### 3. Test Complete Pipeline

```bash
# Start Next.js dev server
npm run dev

# In another terminal
npm run test:pipeline
```

This creates a test job and monitors it through completion.

## 🔥 Most Common Issues

### "Job stuck in queued"
**Fix**: Worker isn't running
```bash
ssh user@74.225.128.201
sudo systemctl start video-worker
```

### "Job fails with upload error"
**Fix**: Azure container doesn't exist
```bash
az storage container create --name videos --account-name italha0
```

### "Can't create job"
**Fix**: Appwrite collections don't exist
See `SETUP_VIDEO_GENERATION.md` Step 1 for schemas

## 📋 Complete Setup Checklist

  - [ ] Database `68d22ef500286098806d` exists
  - [ ] Collection `video_jobs` created with schema
  - [ ] Collection `video_renders` created with schema
  - [ ] API key has correct permissions

- [ ] **Azure Storage**
  - [ ] Storage account `italha0` exists
  - [ ] Container `videos` created
  - [ ] Connection string in `.env.local` and `worker.env`

- [ ] **Azure VM Worker**
  - [ ] Node.js installed
  - [ ] Dependencies installed (`npm install`)
  - [ ] Chromium installed
  - [ ] `worker.env` configured with all variables
  - [ ] Systemd service created and running

- [ ] **Frontend**
  - [ ] `.env.local` has all Appwrite variables
  - [ ] `RENDER_MODE=worker` set

## 🧪 Testing

### Test 1: Appwrite
```bash
npm run test:appwrite
```
✅ Should pass all checks

### Test 2: Pipeline
```bash
npm run test:pipeline
```
✅ Should create job → process → complete → download

### Test 3: Worker (on Azure VM)
```bash
bash worker-health-check.sh
```
✅ Should pass all checks

## 🚀 Running Your System

### Development
```bash
# Start Next.js
npm run dev

# Worker runs on Azure VM (already started via systemd)
```

### Monitor Worker
```bash
# SSH to Azure VM
ssh user@74.225.128.201

# Watch logs in real-time
sudo journalctl -u video-worker -f
```

### Check Job Status
1. Open Appwrite Console
2. Go to Database → video_jobs
3. Find your job
4. Check `status` field

## 🆘 Need Help?

### Check Logs
```bash
# Next.js logs
npm run dev  # Watch console output

# Worker logs (Azure VM)
sudo journalctl -u video-worker -f

# Appwrite logs
# Go to Appwrite Console → Logs
```

### Debug Each Component

1. **Frontend**: Check browser console for API errors
2. **Appwrite**: Check Console → Database for job documents
3. **Worker**: Check `sudo journalctl -u video-worker -f`
4. **Azure Storage**: Check Portal → Storage → Containers → videos

### Run Diagnostics

```bash
# Test everything
npm run test:appwrite   # Appwrite connection
npm run test:pipeline   # Complete workflow

# On Azure VM
bash worker-health-check.sh  # Worker setup
```
